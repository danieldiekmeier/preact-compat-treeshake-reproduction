## Without importing `memo`

```sh
npx webpack -p without-memo.js
```

Output:

```

## With importing `memo`

```sh
npx webpack -p with-memo.js
```

Output:

```

    | ./with-memo.js 182 bytes [built]
    |     + 3 hidden modules
```

As you can see: Even though in the `with-memo.js`, I only wanted to import `memo`, the bundle is actually 6.47kb larger â€“ but the `memo` function is much smaller, even with its dependencies. (https://github.com/developit/preact/blob/master/compat/src/index.js#L281)
